## Dataset
bb
The dataset contained following files:
* `listings.csv`  as
* `calendar.csv` as
* `reviews.csv` as

The datasets can be found on Kaggle separately for [Seattle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle) and [Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston).

### Description of files
- `data` folder contains datasets relevant to the project

### Libraries used in the project
- `pandas` to store and process dataframes created from datasets
- `numpy` to perform some operations on underlying multidimensional array backing the dataframe in Pandas
- `matplotlib` to create plots for showing graphical visualizations of analysis
- `sklearn` to create machine learning models from dataset
- `seaborn` to create special types of data visualizations like Heatmap

I followed the steps recommended in [CRISP-DM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining) methodology to explore this dataset, perform necessary transformations, extracting features and prepare statistical model from it to estimate the booking price of the property on Airbnb.
